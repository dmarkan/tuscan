    And my name is Godwin btw</p>
  <p id="text12"><br>Very well, let's go to this Merchant now...</p>

  <p id="story">You and Halfling exited the tavern and found yourself in the dark street of the Stone Cold,
    your eyes tried to find Orc but he's nowhere to be seen...
  </p>
  <p id="story2">You've escaped from the battle and now you'll never be able
    to retrieve this object that the Orc stole and continue this adventure...
  </p>
  <p id="story3">You punched the Orc in the face, but he didn't feel nothing! He killed you with his bare fists!
    I guess the Orcs are literally hard headed...
  </p>
  <p id="story4"><br>You pierced the Orc with your blade and he died instantly!
    A shiny yellow diamond fell from his pocket...
  </p>
  <p id="story5"><br>You kicked the Orc in the groin and he lost conscience!
    A shiny yellow diamond fell from his pocket...
  </p>
  <p id="story6">You took the diamond from the Halfling and later sold it to the Merchant for a few coins, and that's where your adventure ends...
  </p>
  <p id="story7">...and the Halfling gave you a large pile of coins and you parted ways with him,
    your adventure ends here...
  </p>
  <p id="story8">And so they went to the Merchant who lives up in the Snow Mountain
    in hope that he can tell them more about this mysterious yellow diamond...
