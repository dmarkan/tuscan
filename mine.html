  <button id="option2">It seems that we are not alone in this mine after all...</button>
  <button id="option3">Move aside Dwarf, we are passing!</button>
  <button id="option4">WHOA! You scared me!</button>

  <button id="option1_2">My name is Arthur and this is my party, we are going to the Dark Tower to get the Thor hammer</button>

  <p id="story"><br>You enter the underground mine, it's vast, it's empty, or it seems so...
  </p>
  <p id="story2"><br>As you show him the diamond the Merchant eyes got wider
  </p>
  <p id="story3"><br>You left the store without getting any answers, your adventure ends here...
  </p>
  <p id="story4">The duo left the store and went in the search of Thor hammer so they can lift the curse and save Cabot Cove village, but this quest won't be easy, because in the few moments, the enemy will show his face...
  </p>
  <p id="story4">The Dwarf joined the party and they went to the Dark Tower to face the Red Dragon guarding the Thor hammer...
  </p>

  <p id="text">Wow! This mine is huge!</p>
  <p id="text2">It sure is, how come it's empty, there is nobody here?</p>
  <p id="text3">Who goes there?</p>
  <p id="text4">The Dark Tower? Why you wanna go there? There is a big Red Dragon!</p>
  <p id="text5"><br>This is my Mine! Who are you and what are you doing here?</p>
  <p id="text6"><br>Well, I'm not moving anywhere until you tell me who you are!</p>
  <p id="text7"><br>You should be scared! What are you doing here?</p>
  <p id="text8"><br>You fools! You'll never be able to use the Thor hammer, only dwarfs can handle it!</p>
  <p id="text9"><br>I'm Edwin, what are you doing here?</p>
